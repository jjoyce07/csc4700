I wanna devise
a virus
To bring dire straits to your environment
Crush your corporations with a mild touch
Trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to make a super virus
Strong enough to cause blackouts in every single metropolis
Cuz they dont wanna unify us
So fuck it total anarchy
Can't nobody stop us You see late in
the evening
Fucked up on my computer and my mind starts roaming
I create like a heathen
The first cycles of this virus I can send through a modem
Infiltration hits your station
No microsoft or enhanced dos will impede
Society thinks thier safe when
Bingo! harddrive crashes from the rendering
Alot of hackers tryed virus's before
Vaporize your text like so much white out
I want it where a file replication is a chore
Lights out shut down the entire whitehouse
I dont want just a bug that could be corrected
Im erecting immaculate design
Break the nation down section by section
Even to the greatest minds its impossible to find I wanna devise
a virus
to bring dire straits to your environment
crush your corporations with a mild touch
trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I want to develop a super virus
Better by far then that old y 2 k
This 3030 the time of global unification break right through they
terminals, burn em all
Slaves to silicon
Curupt politicians with leaders and thier keywords
F.B.I and spys stealin bombs
Decipitate thier plans in thier face and catch the fever
Everybody loot the stores get your caned goods
Even space stations are having a hard time
Beast keeepers seek to take our manhood
Which results in the form of global aparthied
Ghettos are trash dumps with gas pumps
Exploding and burnt out since before the great union
The last punks walk around like masked monks
Ready to manipulate the data base and break through em
Human rights come in a hudreth place
Mass production has always been number one
New Earth has become a repungnent place
So its time to spread the fear and the thunder some I wanna devise a virus
to bring dire straits to your environment
crush your corporations with a mild touch
trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
I wanna devise a virus
to bring dire straits to your environment
crush your corporations with a mild touch
trash your whole computer system and revert you to papyrus
